# The Comics Test  - Marvel Comics API

## Description

This is a single-page web app that fetches a random story from the Marvel Comics universe featuring the character Sunspot. Upon loading the page, you can expect to see a story's name and description, if available, along with name and image of the characters involved. If a story lacks a description, the app displays "No description available."

Every time the page is load/reload, a request to the Marvel API is made, fetching a random story in which Sunspot is present.

I picked [Sunspot](https://www.marvel.com/characters/sunspot) as my favorite character since the identification is evident: Brazilian, from Rio de Janeiro, dreamed of being a football player and has a girlfriend named Juliana ðŸ™ƒ.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ruby 3.1.2
- Bundler

## Basic Setup

   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Marvel API public and private keys:

   ```plaintext
